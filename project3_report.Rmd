## Introduction

Introduction: The two words I used to search for photos were "tall buildings". I chose these words because I thought the photos that would be displayed would have a large variety of the types of building structures, and since I really like skyscrapers, I thought it would be a cool idea to incorporate these into my project. Here's the screenshot of the first few rows of royalty free photos:

![](top_photos.png)

```{r}
photo_data %>%
  select(pageURL) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

-   I noticed that most of these pictures were landscape, showing the sky along with the building too.
-   I noticed that most of these buildings were far taller than average buildings here in Auckland.
-   I noticed that all photos were either taken in the day, or the late hours of the evening.

Here's the Animated GIF:

## Key Features

### **Max Views**

```{r}
max_views <- photo_data$views %>% max(na.rm = TRUE)
```

The maximum number of views on a single photo was `r max(photo_data$views)`.

### **Total Downloads**

```{r}
total_downloads <- photo_data$downloads %>% sum(na.rm = TRUE)
```

`r sum(photo_data$likes)` was the total number of downloads done of my selected photos on Pixabay.

### **Min Views**

```{r}
min_views <- photo_data$views %>% min(na.rm = TRUE)
```

The minimum number of views on a single photo was `r min(photo_data$views)`.

### **Median Likes**

```{r}
median_likes <- photo_data$likes %>% median(na.rm = TRUE) %>% round()
```

The median number of likes of all of my selected posts were `r round(median(photo_data$likes))`.

## Creativity

I made a plot using the new categorical variable that I created, along with the download_ratio to see whether the number of likes in photos affects the ratio of views to downloads it gets. On top of that, I used labs to title my plot and variables, and fill my bars with colour. Also, I used the stat and position values in the geom bar function to adjust the position of the bars side by side. I also used a css chunk for this assignment even when not necessary for this project, and used that to change the font used for the project.

Here's the Plot that I created :

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(photo_data, aes(x = category, y = download_ratio, fill = category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +  # Display bars side-by-side
  labs(title = "Download Ratio by Category",
       x = "Category",
       y = "Download Ratio",
       fill = "Category")
```


## Learning Reflection

Manipulating the data frames with the dplyr library was one of the key learning objectives for this project, and in this project, I was able to do just that. I used the mutate, filter and select functions in order to create new variables for the data frame, filter out values for it and select specific variables from a bigger dataset, which was the photos JSON file that was given by Pixabay. In future, I would like to learn about how I can use other functions to manipulate data frames further, and also learn about how manipulating data frames can be useful in the real world of Data Science!
