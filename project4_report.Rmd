## INTRODUCTION

The two channels I chose for my project were two Shark Tank channels: in particular, Shark Tank India, and Shark Tank Global). The reason I chose these channels is because, I am very interested in Shark Tank as a whole, it is one of my favourite shows to watch, and I was wondering if having just one region of the show made a difference to the YouTube Analytics generated, as compared to globally, and I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to explore that.

The two ideas I had for exploration before I started the project were:

1.  Seeing if the video title length really affected the number of views the video got; and seeing the frequency of videos by like to view ratio. In order to see whether video title length affected number of views, I just made a scatter plot, where each point represents a video showing its specific count of characters on the x-axis, and the number of views on the y-axis.

2.  In order to see the frequency of videos with specific like to view ratios, I created a Histogram with 30 bins, and plotted the like to view ratio on the x-axis and the frequency on y-axis.

Challenge faced :

I also tried creating a bar chart showing whether the average view duration of a video is affected by its length, however, I realised it is rather obvious that it is pretty much directly correlated, and therefore, decided not to include it in my report. I realised I could not make any useful statistical inference out of this plot.

## DYNAMIC DATA STORY

To show creativity, I used theme that sets the legend to none in my first plot. Apart from that, I also to quantify engagement, I simply added the comment and like count and tried to calculate engagement ration. I used functions like position, arrange, reorder, str_count. Also I tried to uncover a lot of questions which I had by creating 8-10 plots(but only displaying 5 here, which is much more than required). Apart from that, I used different colors, and kept my color theme as "lightcolors", (I did use chatgpt to ask for some colors.) :)

## LEARNING REFLECTION

In the learning objectives for this Module, one of them was regarding the exploration of creating visualisations with ggplot2. Throughout this project, we created a lot of different types of plots with ggplot2, ranging from a histogram, to a scatter plot. Additionally, we used the labs within this to basically make our plots look good. I'm looking forward to ultimately seeing how much further I can go to make our plots look presentable, and learning more about what distinguishes a useful information plot from one that is not very statistically useful. I am also excited to start my introduction to SQL for the first time.
